# Orthogonal Decompositions and the Matchgate Group

# Hoffman Decomposition
This code does two things. First, it implements the Hoffman decomposition of matrices in SO(N) into N(N-1)/2 rotations involving two basis elements each, first described in Hoffman, Raffenetti, and Ruedenberg, J. Math. Phys. 13, 528 (1972). This is done in the file SpecialOrthogonalDecomposition.py.

# Matchgate Circuits
Second, it implements the decomposition of an arbitrary element of SO(2N) into unitary matchgates acting on nearest neighbors. This decomposition was first described in Jozsa and Miyake, Proc. Math. Phys. Eng. Sci. 464, 3089 (2008), although we use a slightly modified version that is simpler. This code is forthcoming.
